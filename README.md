<-- Web Fundamentals
  -One of the products that caught my attention is Web Fundamentals
  -As keen enough to learn and hopefully progress my skills in web development I have learned:
    -A website's cornerstone must feature 4 aspects; Fast, Integrated, Reliable and Engaging
    -FAST, users would want a rapid-responsive website; this means we have to measure the website's performance includes its critical rendering path and Rendering performance eg:
     using RAIL as framework
    -INTEGRATED, by meaning that user's experience should be as comfortable and engaging as possible, their experience lies on how their true feeling through the website
    -Reliable, by making a website available offline, we can enhance the user's satisfaction and engagement with our website eg: Offline cook
    -Engaging, by meaning that the website/app should be as functional as possible with simplicity as the basis of user's experience eg: Push Notifications
